2. Install the dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Set up environment variables:
   - Create a `.env` file in both client and server directories.
   - Set up environment variables for API keys (such as Perenual), database connection (MongoDB URI), and authentication (JWT secret, VAPID keys, etc.).
4. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   This will start both the frontend and backend servers.

## Usage

- **Manage Plants**: Add plants to your collection and see them reflected in your profile with gamification badges based on plant count.
- **Create Posts**: Navigate to the forum section and create new posts. Comment on others' posts to engage with the community.

### Key Files and Folders:

- `client/src/components/` - Contains reusable React components.
- `server/models/` - MongoDB models for users, posts, plants, and comments.
- `server/resolvers.js` - GraphQL resolvers for queries and mutations.
- `server/typeDefs.js` - GraphQL schema definitions.

## API Integration

- **Perenual API**: The app integrates with [Perenual API](https://perenual.com/) to fetch plant data based on user search terms. This API provides plant information such as species, sunlight needs, and watering frequency.

  In order to make API requests, ensure you have a valid API key from the Perenual API and set it up in your `.env` file as follows:

You can sign up for a free Perenual API key [here](https://perenual.com/signup).
